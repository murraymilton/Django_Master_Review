## Overview

This repository hosts a Django-based web application developed as a part of my coursework through [Python & Django - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-the-practical-guide/learn/lecture/26372998#overview) on Udemy. It serves as a testament to my hands-on experience with Django, demonstrating my ability to design, implement, and deploy web applications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, logout, and password reset functionalities.
- **Database Design**: Efficient data retrieval and complex data relationships with Django's ORM.
- **Dynamic Content**: A CMS for dynamic content updates.
- **RESTful API**: For structured data exchange.
- **Responsive Design**: Using Bootstrap for a seamless cross-device experience.
- **Security**: Protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

## What I Learned

- **Django Framework**: Mastery of Django's architecture and advanced features.
- **Web Development Principles**: MVC architecture, DRY principle, and code maintainability.
- **Deployment**: Skills in deploying applications to production environments.
